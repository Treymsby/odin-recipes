    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar </li>
        <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed) </li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced </li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced </li>
        <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. <br> Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in 6 tablespoons rice vinegar to the hot rice. <br> Spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>
            Place 1 sheet of seaweed on bamboo mat, press a thin layer of cool rice on the seaweed. <br> 
            Leave at least 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. <br>
            This is for easier sealing later.
            <br> Dot some wasabi on the rice. Arrange cucumber, avocado and smoked salmon to the rice. 
            <br> Position them about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of the seaweed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slightly wet the top edge of the seaweed. Roll from bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat tightly.
            <br> Cut roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.
        </li>
    </ol>
